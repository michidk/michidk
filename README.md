<h2>Hi, I'm Michael Lohr!</h2>
<p><em>Because a Great Idea Is Never Enough</em></p>
<p>
Passionate about software development, software design/architecture, web technologies, distributed systems, containers, and game development.

I started freelancing in 2015 to realize smaller web projects in my spare time. In 2016 I worked together with 3D artists to create models for game development, which we sold on various online stores. Eventually, I founded Broken Vector UG to expand this business. At this time, we were multiple people working on developing 3D models and software for game developers. In 2017 we released a Virtual Reality software called VoxVR on Steam, which allows the creation of 3D voxel models. 

Currently, I study computer science (M. Sc.) at Technische Universität München (TUM). 
My company, Lohr IT, develops various software solutions (focused on web and cloud technologies) for startups and mid-sized businesses.
